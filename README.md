# React Project

## Description
<hr>

This mobile and desktop friendly web application helps procrastinators with quickly creating a grocery list. Backed by thousands of real recipes, this app simply consolidates the ingredients needed for all intended recipes. 

## Design & Wireframes
<hr>

The app consists of three main components. A main component that keeps the selected recipes and ingredients in order; the search component that allows the user to search for a recipe; and the information component that lists the selected recipe's ingredients.

The original design was created in Canva and collected together in Figma. Here was the original wireframe.

## Technologies Used
<hr>

### React, JavaScript, CSS
This application was built with React JS. Nine components were created in this app. In order to track selected recipes, the UseState and UseContext are relied on.

### Export
Because the user's activities are erased every time the app reloads, I installed an "save to clipboard" function. This allows the user to easily copy/paste the recipes and ingredients to their notes for future reference.

### API Fetch
API calls are being made to [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/). The call returns links to recipes, ingredients, and images.
